# PROJECT: Rebuild the TI4 project

## REASONS: 
- No time limit on this build.
- I can tackle the JS in a nicer way
- As I now know exactly what the end product will be and do, I can build using a more logical approach
- I will be able to add much more functionality (maybe an admin level, too)
- I'm a coding addict


## Steps Completed:
- ### ~~Start a readMe~~
- ### ~~Create an exe builder to automate the twig setup~~
